# CuppaTea
Web App - Timer and reminder for your perfect cup of tea!

Hi please try out the CuppaTea app.

For this app I've used vanilla javaScript to obtain the user information on the cup of tea they have just made, then calculate the perfect
brewing time according to the user's variables. A timer will then be set and alert the user when it is ready.

The same applies for when the tea will start to become cold. This is calculated seperately as a tea with a thicker cream or more milk will
get cold quicker to begin with, however it will then hold its heat better.

I have used OOP to program the app, and modules to seperate the different areas of code. Therefore each module could be used independently
and they don't communicate witheach other, only communicating via a controller module.

The app can also be used on a mobile, however alerts still need to be made functional.

Thanks, and enjoy the app.
